### Welcome to my profile!

I'm a freelance data analyst who has a political science background of a quantitative nature, and have recently graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Department of Political Science with a Master of Arts. I wrote a Master's paper demonstrating an inverse relationship between repression and low-level bribery in a large-n study. I prefer to approach questions through this lens, believing that a good quantity of properly collected data, coupled with skilled utilization of this data, will lead to greater insights relative to small-n studies.

Recognizing the importance of quality in data collection, I pride myself on my ability to clean and tidy data, and believe that there is value in presenting data in a descriptive format to understand simple trends and patterns. Sometimes, there is value in simplicity. Should the initial analyses be insufficient or prompt deeper questioning, I am more than capable of digging into it with predictive statistics.

I also place great value on not only running good analyses, but also presenting findings in a coherent, effective, and understandable manner. In practice, this translates to good data visualization practices. I take great pride in constructing simple yet effective graphs and figures with which I can explain my findings to a wide, diverse range of audiences.

I primarily utilise the R programming language through the RStudio IDE, finding the language to be quite helpful in data cleaning and preparation, as well as data analysis. That being said, I'm learning Python and am eager to incorporate it into my work where possible, particularly where it provides advantages over R.
