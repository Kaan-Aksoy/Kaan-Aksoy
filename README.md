### Welcome to my profile!

I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at the Department of Political Science.

My primary interests lie in democratic backsliding, competitive authoritarianism, institutions in hybrid and authoritarian regimes, and a little in political behaviour in such systems of government. I approach my research mostly from a quantitative angle, preferring large-n study as opposed to small-n case studies.
