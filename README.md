### Welcome to my profile!

I'm a freelance data analyst who has a political science background of a quantitative nature, and have graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Department of Political Science with a Master of Arts. My Master's paper was focused on corruption in autocratic regimes, where I proposed an inverse causal relationship between the cost of repression and low-level bribery.

My primary interests lie in democratic backsliding, comparative authoritarianism, institutions in hybrid and authoritarian regimes, and a little in political behaviour in such systems of government. I approach my research mostly from a quantitative angle, preferring large-n study as opposed to small-n case studies. On the more technical side of things, I am interested in learning more about Bayesian statistics and practicing it, alongside predictive modelling.

I also place great value on not only running good analyses, but also presenting findings in a coherent, effective, and understandable manner. In practice, this translates to good data visualisation practices. I take great pride in constructing simple yet effective graphs and figures with which I can explain my findings to a wide range of audiences.

I primarily utilise the R programming language through the RStudio IDE. That being said, I'm learning Python and am eager to incorporate it into my work where possible, particularly where it provides advantages over R.
