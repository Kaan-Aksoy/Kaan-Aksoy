### Welcome to my profile!

I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at the Department of Political Science.

My primary interests lie in democratic backsliding, comparative authoritarianism, institutions in hybrid and authoritarian regimes, and a little in political behaviour in such systems of government. I approach my research mostly from a quantitative angle, preferring large-n study as opposed to small-n case studies. On the more technical side of things, I am interested in learning more about Bayesian statistics and practicing it, alongside predictive modelling.

I primarily utilise the R programming language through the RStudio IDE. That being said, I'm learning Python and am eager to incorporate it into my work where possible, particularly where it provides advantages over R.

Within this public repository, you can find the works that I've completed and have decided to share for you to see. Feel free to contact me about the details!
